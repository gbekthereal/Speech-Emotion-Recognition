Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the process of extracting emotional linguistic information from speech. It is a field of growing interest and
potential applications in Human-Computer Interaction, management content, in social interaction and as an additional module in systems
speech and text-to-text recognition. The performance of such applications depends much of a high-quality speech emotion recognition dataset.

This project was done through the site Kaggle.
You have to use the notebook provided by Kaggle and upload the dataset Acted Emotional Speech Dynamic Database, in order to run the code.

The Acted Emotional Speech Dynamic Database (AESDD) is a publicly available speech emotion recognition dataset, where it contains
pronunciations of active emotional speech in the Greek language.
The database contains five emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness and sadness.
